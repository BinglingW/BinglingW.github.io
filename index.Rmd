## About Me

I am fascinated with applying my cutting-edge knowledge of behavioral and decision science to solve real-world problems. I would like to help people make more beneficial choices. I would like to design and promote human-centered ideas and products to make the world better.

I love working in a fast-paced environment. I enjoy transferring insights from multiple fields into comprehensive workable actions. I am enthusiastic about taking on challenges and exploring the unknown.
