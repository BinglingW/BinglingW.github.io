These Design Challenges are program-initiated, four-to-six-week competitions that allowed students to apply their insights on behavioral and decision science to help solve the clients' problems in the real world. Collaborating with my colleagues, I conducted primary and secondary research, synthesized the research information, and extrapolated from the information directions for future business strategies or a specific intervention/product to change people's behavior.
