<h2>5.Finding The Best Model to Predict Using Stepwise Regression</h2>
<p>The model built by <strong>forward stepwise selection</strong> (model 1) has an Adjusted R-square of 0.3134. The model built by <strong>backward stepwise selection</strong> (model 2) has an Adjusted R-squre of 0.3236. Since model 2 has a slightly larger predictive power, we will use model 2 instead of model 1.</p>
